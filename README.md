## 📌 Project Overview  
This project investigates how **machine learning models** can enhance **equity selection and portfolio construction** for European equities. It evaluates whether **imposing constraints on mean-variance portfolio weights** improves risk-adjusted performance when expected returns are proxied using machine learning–predicted probabilities of outperformance.  

The study uses the historical constituents of the **Stoxx 50 Index** with weekly data from 2004–2025.

## ⚙️ Methodology  
- **Models:** Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net, Random Forest, LightGBM  
- **Ensembles:** Combined forecasts to improve robustness  
- **Forecast Target:** Binary classification of weekly stock outperformance vs. median return  
- **Portfolio Construction:**  
  - Equal- and value-weighted benchmarks  
  - Mean-variance optimization (with and without constraints)  
  - Constraints tested from 20–30% per asset  
- **Validation:** Purged K-Fold with embargo (per López de Prado, 2018)  
- **Risk Assessment:** Exposure to Fama-French 5 factors

## 📊 Key Findings  
- Constrained mean-variance portfolios (20–28% range) achieved **superior risk-adjusted returns**.  
- A **30% constrained mean-variance portfolio** nearly doubled benchmark Sharpe Ratios while reducing maximum drawdowns.  
- **Machine learning signals** performed best during slowdowns and recessions, serving as a hedge during market stress.  
- **Macroeconomic indicators** (term spreads, credit spreads, volatility) were significant drivers, except in Random Forest models.

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, scikit-learn, LightGBM, Optuna, pandas, NumPy  
- **Data Sources:** Bloomberg Terminal, ECB Data, OECD Data, Kenneth French Data Library, FRED  
- **Analytics:** Portfolio optimization, Fama-French regressions, SHAP feature importance
